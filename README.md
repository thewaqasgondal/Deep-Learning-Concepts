# Deep-Learning-Concepts

This repository is a comprehensive collection of deep learning experiments and concepts, covering everything from basic fundamentals to advanced techniques. It serves as a practical guide and codebase for learning and implementing deep learning models, algorithms, and applications.

## Overview

The repository is organized to provide a structured learning path:

- **Basic Concepts**: Introduction to neural networks, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.
- **Intermediate Topics**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and common architectures.
- **Advanced Experiments**: Cutting-edge techniques like transformers, generative models, reinforcement learning, and custom implementations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thewaqasgondal/Deep-Learning-Concepts.git
   cd Deep-Learning-Concepts
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Each experiment is contained in its own file or notebook. Start with the numbered files (e.g., `00_test.ipynb`, `01_test_env.py`) to verify your setup, then explore the concepts in order.
